This is a simple file management program.It has 4 functions.
- Creating a file.
- Reading from a specified file, amount of data to read (in bytes), and from where to read
- Writing to a specified file, amount of data to write (in bytes), and from where to write
- Display statistical information of a specified file including owner, permissions, and inode.
- Create a copy of a given file, and the user will provide the source and destination files.

To peform the above operations we have 4 options:
-c	creates a file 
SYNTAX	:	./objectfile -c [filename] [mode] 
example	:	./a -c demo.txt 0666


-r	read from a file
SYNTAX	:	./objectfile -r [filename] [amount of data to read in bytes] [offset in the file] [offset w.r.t to file's start or end (put 0 for start,2 for end)]
example :	./a -r demo.txt 5 2 0


-w	write to a file taking input from console
SYNTAX	:	./objectfile -w [filename] [optionflag(Use 0 to write,1 to append,2 to truncate)] [amount of data to write in bytes] [offset in file] [offset w.r.t to file's start or end (put 0 for start,2 for end)]
example	:	./a -w demo.txt 0 10 0 0


-s	Display statistics of the file
SYNTAX	:	./objectfile -s [filename]
example	:	./a -s demo.txt


-v	copy content of source file to the destniation file
SYNTAX	:	./objectfile -v [source file] [destination file]
example	:	./a -v demo.txt copyofdemo.txt


--help	this will print information about how to give arguments in command line.
